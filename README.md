## More about the Features
### 3.7V LiPo Powered
The Lithium Polymer Li(NiCoMn)O2 Battery is a type of rechargeable battery based on the original lithium ion chemistry, created by the use of nickel(Ni), cobalt(Co), manganese(Mn),as a cathode material. LiPo cells have a flexible, foil-type (polymer laminate) case, so they are relatively unconstrained. Withing reduced electrolyte,further enhancig battery safety and being able to be positioned in any direction.
Already passed all of the safety tests(overcharge, overdischarge, over temperature, short circuit, drop, Crush, Needle puncture tests, etc). These battery cells do not catch fire, no explosion and no leakage.

### NEO 6M GPS Module
The u-blox NEO-6M global positioning system (GPS) module, a very popular, cost-effective, high-performance GPS module with a ceramic patch antenna, an on-board memory chip, and a backup battery that can be conveniently integrated with a broad range of microcontrollers.

### LoRa SX1278 Ra-02 Ai thinker
Anxinke LoRa series modules (Ra-01/Ra-02) are designed and developed by Anxinke Technology. The radio frequency chip of this series of modules SX1278 mainly uses LoRa™ remote modem for ultra-long-distance spread spectrum communication. It has strong anti-interference and can Minimize current consumption. With the help of SEMTECH's LoRa™ patented modulation technology, SX1278 has a high sensitivity of over -148dBm, a power output of +20dBm, a long transmission distance and high reliability. At the same time, compared with traditional modulation technology, LoRa™ modulation technology also has obvious advantages in anti-blocking and selection, which solves the problem of distance, anti-interference and power consumption that traditional design solutions cannot simultaneously take into account.

### Barometer BMP280
The BMP280 consists of a Piezo-resistive pressure sensing element and a mixed-signal ASIC. The ASIC performs A/D conversions and provides the conversion results and sensor specific compensation data through a digital interface. BMP280 provides highest flexibility to the designer and can be adapted to the requirements regarding accuracy, measurement time and power consumption by selecting from a high number of possible combinations of the sensor settings.

### Accelerometer and Gyro MPU6050
The MPU-6050 is the world’s first integrated 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis 
gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP) all in a small 4x4x0.9mm 
package. With its dedicated I2C sensor bus, it directly accepts inputs from an external 3-axis compass to 
provide a complete 9-axis MotionFusion™ output. The MPU-60X0 MotionTracking device, with its 6-axis 
integration, on-board MotionFusion™, and run-time calibration firmware, enables manufacturers to eliminate 
the costly and complex selection, qualification, and system level integration of discrete devices, guaranteeing 
optimal motion performance for consumers. The MPU-60X0 is also designed to interface with multiple noninertial digital sensors, such as pressure sensors, on its auxiliary I
2C port.
